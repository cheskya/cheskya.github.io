                <h3 id="whatIsIt">What is it?</h3>
                <p>Gender stereotypes affect everyone, no matter what their gender may be. These stereotypes can greatly impact a person's life, especially when it comes to mental health.</p>
                <p>Gender stereotypes can direclty affect one's mental health by causing further stress. A study by Kucharska (2018) shows that lower self-esteem in women is linked to the gender discrimination they receive.</p>
                <img src="graphics/images/discrimination-against-women.jpg">
                <p>However, gender stereotypes are also present in the mental health care field itself, hindering many from getting the help they need. The possibility and risk of discrimination can scare people away, worsening their mental health with no other way to get better.</p>
                <p>In a survey  conducted on transgender people in the United States, one-third of respondents reported having a negative experience with their mental health care provider, while about one-quarter reported not seeking help out of fear of being mistreated (James et al., 2016). Similarly, because men are characterized to be tough, vulnerability can trigger shame and prevent them from seeking help (Rice et al., 2021).</p>

                <h3 id="whyStillHere">Why is it still here?</h3>
                <p>Gender stereotypes are difficult to eliminate, and despite our best efforts, they are still unavoidable today. The truth remains that they are deeply ingrained in society, and one reason for that may be because of its immediate advantages.</p>
                <p>Stereotyping, in general, allows one to quickly respond to familiar situations, which reduces the amount of thinking required (McLeod, 2015). This may explain why some people hold onto their stereotypes very firmly.</p>
