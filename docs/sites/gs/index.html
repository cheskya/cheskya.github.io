            <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <h3 id="whatIsIt">What is it?</h3>
            <p>Gender stereotypes affect everyone, no matter what their gender may be. These stereotypes can greatly
              impact a person's life, especially when it comes to mental health.</p>
            <p>Gender stereotypes can direclty affect one's mental health by causing further stress. A study by
              Kucharska (2018) shows that lower self-esteem in women is linked to the gender discrimination they
              receive.</p>
            <img src="graphics/images/discrimination-against-women.jpg">
            <p>However, gender stereotypes are also present in the mental health care field itself, hindering many from
              getting the help they need. The possibility and risk of discrimination can scare people away, worsening
              their mental health with no other way to get better.</p>
            <p>In a survey conducted on transgender people in the United States, one-third of respondents reported
              having a negative experience with their mental health care provider, while about one-quarter reported not
              seeking help out of fear of being mistreated (James et al., 2016). Similarly, because men are
              characterized to be tough, vulnerability can trigger shame and prevent them from seeking help (Rice et
              al., 2021).</p>

            <p>Gender stereotypes are difficult to eliminate, and despite our best efforts, they are still unavoidable
              today. The truth remains that they are deeply ingrained in society, and one reason for that may be because
              of its immediate advantages.</p>
            <p>Stereotyping, in general, allows one to quickly respond to familiar situations, which reduces the amount
              of thinking required (McLeod, 2015). This may explain why some people hold onto their stereotypes very
              firmly.</p>
