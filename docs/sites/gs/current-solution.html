                <h2>CURRENT SOLUTION</h2>

                <h3 id="antiDiscriminationLaw">Anti-Discrimination Laws</h3>
                <p>Today, in response to the problem of gender stereotyping, anti-discrimination laws are gradually being implemented around the world.</p>
                <p>The exact contents of these laws vary from place to place, but in general, these laws make use of punishments such as fines, termination, or improsonment.</p>
                <p>While it sounds good on paper, the truth is that these laws are not executed effectively, and in some cases, only aggravate the problem further.</p>
                
                <br>

                <h3 id="lawPhilippines">The Law in Action: Philippines</h3>
                <p>In the Philippines, though there is a lack of a national anti-discrimination law, more cities have begun to implement their own. One example would be Quezon City, who passed its Gender-Fair Ordinance in 2014 (Abad, 2022).</p>
                <p>Yet, despite this law, discrimination continued. Gretchen Diaz, a transgender woman, demonstrated this when she was barred from using the restroom of her choice, later being arrested (Talabong, 2019).</p>

                <h3 id="lawCanada">The Law in Action: Canada</h3>
                <p>In Canada, though similar anti-discrimination laws are in place, people continue to be discriminated against at work. In her article, Doolittle (2021) describes how women are forced to endure discrimination and harassment at work all so they can keep their salaries and reputation.</p>
                <p>She goes on to note that though these women file complaints, it can take years before they are acted upon, and even then, the effort is oftentimes wasted as investigations either don't turn out to be in their favor, or the damages done are small enough that companies treat it as part of business, doing nothing to stop the discrimination for the long-term. This long and tiresome process deters people from getting the justice they need, worsening the problem further.</p>

                <h3 id="flawedSystem">A Flawed System</h3>
                <p>The law offers punishment, but it does little in actually preventing discrimination. In some cases, the laws' punishments and processes may even work against the people they are trying to protect.</p>
                <p>Gender stereotypes will continue, even as more of these anti-discrimination laws are passed and implemented. Though better enforcement may prove to be beneficial, it's effects will only be for the short-term, and will not address the actual problem, which are the stereotypes themselves.</p>
                <p>Thus, we must aim for a more preventive approach.</p>
