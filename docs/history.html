                    <h2>The History of Fighting Games</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fighting games were long started in 1976 with the game Heavyweight Champ.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The genre&#39;s popularity rose during the 1980s when titles such as Karate Champ
                            and Yie Ar Kung-Fu were released. The format in these games was also used as
                            a basis for many modern fighting games. Players play best-of-three matches
                            with different characters to choose from, each with a particular personality
                            and fighting style. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In 1987, Capcom released its first version of Street Fighter. Its sequel, Street
                            Fighter II, was released four years later and is credited as the start of the
                            fighting game boom. Street Fighter II has a pool of playable characters with
                            specialized command-based moves.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, Street Fighter II&#39;s isolated glory halted when its fiercest competitor,
                            Mortal Kombat, was released in 1992. Mortal Kombat is maybe the most divisive game
                            ever released, with its darker, bloodier, more lifelike tone and aesthetic. Due to
                            its &quot;fatalities,&quot; several court cases were called, and the first discussion of
                            whether video games should be outlawed and if they contribute to children&#39;s bad
                            behavior was sparked. Still, the franchise managed to sell over 30 million copies
                            all over the globe by 2012.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            During the late 1990s, despite the advent of fantastic titles like Tekken 2 and 3, the
                            popularity of the fighting game genre started to decline substantially. Other than Super
                            Smash Bros, no other title could recapture the exact height of popularity as Street
                            Fighter II and Mortal Kombat I and II (Gilyadov, 2015).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The next major installment in the Street Fighter series was eventually released in 2009,
                            with about the same impact as Street Fighter II. New fighting games started to be created
                            after Street Fighter IV&#39;s successful release, and the FGC grew by adding additional tournaments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Streamers even began live-streaming the competitions on Twitch so that many people could watch them.
                            Franchises sponsor games as well as compensate players for free advertising.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, many FGC members have rejected the term &quot;Esports&quot; in their community. These specific group
                            members only continue to represent a very modest part of the fighting game market. This genre will endure.
                            Street Fighter V and Mortal Kombat X generate a lot of anticipation (Ultimate Pop Culture Wiki, n.d).

                    <h2>The History of EVO</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            EVO started its humble beginnings in 1996.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tom Cannon, the founder of Shoryuken.com, staged the modest West Coast Street Fighter arcade competition known
                            as &quot;Battle by the Bay&quot; in 1996, which served as the forerunner to the current EVO World Finals. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            These original tournaments had fewer competitors entering, where participants only numbered around the hundreds. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Battle by the Bay&#39;s moniker was eventually changed to Evolution, signaling the start of significant modifications
                             to the tournament events.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By 2004, the organizers decided to replace arcade systems with home consoles. This decision sparked controversy
                            within the community; however, during this era, people practiced more on home consoles that were already technologically
                            advanced and capable of replicating current arcade titles. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Controversies also surrounded the tournament events, which focused more on player rivalries, such as Duc Do vs. Sanford Kelly
                            and clockw0rk vs. ShadyK.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The most famous match and &quot;rivalry&quot; in EVO happened in 2004 and belonged to Daigo &quot;The Beast&quot; Umehara and Justin Wong&#39;s battle
                            on Street Fighter III.  Daigo could sense Justin&#39;s intent and evaded all 14 of his hits. Daigo even ended the struggle with his
                            combo, which secured his victory. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In those years when there were no new fighting game releases, EVO continued to exist and expand. 2005 saw the first relocation
                            of the competition to Las Vegas, while 2006 saw the first and last selection of a non-fighting game for an EVO tournament spot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Capcom released the eagerly anticipated Street Fighter IV to Japanese arcades in 2008, then released a significantly improved
                            home console version in the West in 2009. Due to Street Fighter IV, more players were interested in fighting games again, and
                            the promise of fighting games in eSports drew the interest of potential sponsors.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Street Fighter IV was added to the roster during EVO 2009, which resulted in a sharp increase in tournament registrations.
                            A record for EVO with more than 1,000 competitors squaring off would be set, which would be broken year after year (Migliacio, 2014).
