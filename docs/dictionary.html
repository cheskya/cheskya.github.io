                    <p>
                        Because there are hundreds of terms used across multiple fighting games, a member of the community who goes by the name of
                        Infil recently made a website explaining every term in detail to serve as a resource for newcomers as well as people who
                        want to refresh their knowledge on a certain term. Not only has every term been ordered alphabetically &#8212; the terms have
                        also been separated depending on the specific game it belongs to! 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To give a small demonstration of the dictionary, we&#39;ll be taking a look at 5 of 10 essential FGC terms (according to FGC streamer
                        and influencer jmcrofts) and their definition according to the website.

                        <h3>Tiger Knee</h3>
                        <p>
                            A method to perform a special move in the air as fast as possible after you leave the ground. Almost always abbreviated to TK.
                            If you wanted to do an instant quarter circle forward air move, for example, you would instead do the quarter circle while on the
                            ground, and then continue to roll your joystick to up-forward to jump. Then, you can simply just press your attack button and
                            the game should save your quarter circle input long enough to have it count as the air move. Using numpad notation, this would
                            be 2369, or 2147 for quarter circle back moves (Crofts, 2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In essence, rather than jumping and then inputting your special move, you input the special move first, and then jump. The
                            technique is named after the input for Sagat&#39;s Tiger Knee Crush, which was 2369 in Street Fighter II (even though it has been
                            changed to a DP motion in modern games, which makes this term's meaning even more difficult to figure out) (Crofts, 2018).
                        </p>

                        <h3>DP</h3>
                        <p>
                            A powerful rising uppercut attack that is great for anti-air and is usually invincible, making it great for reversal attacks.
                            A dragon punch, or &quot;DP&quot; as it is commonly abbreviated, is a big catch-all term for any motion attack (usually a DP motion)
                            that sees the character attack towards the air with their fist, usually leaving their feet (Crofts, 2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They were first seen with Ryu and Ken&#39;s shoryuken attacks in Street Fighter II, and as such usually most shotos have a version of
                            it, but this style of attack is now extremely common in dozens of fighting games and hundreds of fighting game characters. This
                            term is basically synonymous with shoryuken and uppercut, although "DP" is the most common just because it's catchy and short (Crofts, 2018).

                        <h3>Meaty</h3>
                        <p>
                            A term with two distinct but sometimes overlapping definitions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most common definition of meaty is an attack that hits an opponent on the very first frame possible after they rise from a
                            knockdown (or other similar situations, like being flipped out). This guarantees the opponent must either block the attack,
                            or immediately do an invincible move (like a dragon punch). If they just press any random button, they will get counter hit
                            because their attack still has to go through its non-hitting startup, but your attack is already active on top of them.
                            Learning how to time a meaty is extremely important to fighting game strategy, and you can often just beat beginners by
                            meatying them over and over as they insist on attacking at all times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other definition of meaty is an attack that makes contact with the opponent not on its first active frame like normal,
                            but on a later active frame instead. This will generate the same hit stun or block stun, but you&#39;ll recover sooner and you&#39;ll
                            generate more frame advantage, and possibly unlock some new combos. These two definitions often go hand in hand! When you
                            attack someone as they rise from a knockdown, sometimes your attack won&#39;t hit on the first active frame, but rather some
                            later frame. That would be a meaty that hits meaty. A little confusing, for sure, but just wait until you try to understand
                            what a fuzzy is (Crofts, 2018).

                        <h3>Footsies</h3>
                        <p>
                            A complicated, often nebulous term that refers to the battle for controlling the space in front of you, often by using
                            good pokes. In essence, you are trying to get to a range you like, while trying to deny your opponent getting to a
                            range that they like. How you do this varies wildly based on the game, but it often involves using strong crouching
                            kick attacks to pester your opponent as they are trying to walk around. This dance of playing mind games with your
                            feet is the source of the term's name (Crofts, 2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In reality, footsies can mean different things to different people, and often combines lots of adjacent concepts.
                            Some people think that footsies needs to be a grounded affair, between characters that don&#39;t jump and fight for
                            space only by walking. While this is a good example, I think applying the term narrow-mindedly to only these situations
                            is falling out of favor. As more people play more diverse fighting games, they are realizing that you get the &quot;feel&quot;
                            of footsies in lots of different ways, and this battle for space can extend to the air, or to movement options beyond
                            walking, quite easily. That said, using amazing footsies to perform an awesome whiff punish will never fall out of style (Crofts, 2018).

                        <h3>Oki</h3>
                        <p>
                            The mind games and mixups that occur around attacking and blocking when someone is rising from a knockdown. It is pretty
                            synonymous with the term wakeup, although okizeme tends to refer mostly to the offensive side and which choice of attack
                            they will use, while wakeup refers more to the total situation. But in practice, the terms are often interchanged without
                            much problem. Okizeme is a Japanese word (pronounced oh-kee-zeh-meh) and it's often shortened to &quot;oki&quot; (Crofts, 2018).
