                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The two most important qualifications for a commentator were straightforward: an understanding of the game being commented
                            on and the capacity to do it in an engaging way. The ability to distinguish one caster from another was also greatly aided
                            by personality. In both cases, these were the same for both conventional and esports analysis. Giving a running commentary
                            of a game or match is the responsibility of a commentator or caster for a broadcast. They must put the viewer's attention
                            on what is happening at any given moment (Manne, 2018).

                            Casting, sometimes known as shoutcasting, is the process of explaining what is happening during a match or game in such
                            a way that viewers can follow the action and understand what is happening at any particular moment. Additionally, the
                            broadcaster needs to be able to engage the audience and make the broadcast entertaining. They effectively serve as home
                            viewers' entertainment, making the game entertaining to watch (Manne, 2018).

                    Here is an example of a clip showing how commentators or casters utilize the language to teach the audience on what is happening
                    in the game as well as to entertain. In the video, you can hear the casters use terms like &quot;anti-air,&quot; which refers to attacks
                    that are optimized for hitting opponents who are airborne, &quot;confirm,&quot; which describes making sure your opponent was hit by a move
                    before proceeding with more attacks, &quot;V-shift,&quot; which is a defensive technique used to parry an attack and get away from the
                    opponent, and lastly, the V-Trigger, which varies based on the character and is activated by simultaneously hitting the Heavy
                    Punch and Heavy Kick buttons, among many other terms (Capcom, n.d.; EVO, 2022; Fandom, n.d.).

                    <p>
                        In the realm of esports, events are extremely important. Even though gamers are connected to one another and are always chatting,
                        events encourage more direct physical contact and involvement. Along with the games, there is also entertainment in the form of concerts,
                        cosplay contests, and celebrity appearances where gaming enthusiasts and followers gather to watch and support their favorite teams
                        and players. Competitions are formal events; they are not casual get-togethers (Salama, 2020).

                        The Evolution Champion Series, or EVO 2022, a yearly sporting event that mostly focused on fighting games, was hosted at the Mandalay
                        Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, as an example of a community event. The Mainstage Ultimate, Smash Summit 11, Glitch 8.5
                        Konami Code, Mammoth Invitational North America, BCS Last Chance Qualifiers Europe & South America, and finally the REV Major,
                        the country's premier fighting game competition, are further noteworthy events. These are only a few examples of the occasions
                        that support the esports fighting game scene (Lahftel, 2022).

                        These are platforms in which players can communicate to each other and talk about fighting games. Aside from social media platforms
                        like Twitter, popular forums include websites such as <a href="https://archive.supercombo.gg/" target="_blank">shoryuken.com</a> (known now as <a href="https://forums.supercombo.gg/" target="_blank">SuperCombo</a>) 
                        (Shoryuken.net, n.d.; SuperCombo.gg, n.d.).

                    <h3>Community-made learning resources</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are also online guides for fighting games which assist in learning the mechanics of the game or a specific character.
                        Such websites include Mizuumi, Dream Cancel for King of Fighters games, Dustloop for Arc System Works games, and Super Combo
                        for Street Fighter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These forums and resources almost always use fighting game terminologies to get ideas across, such as certain actions or situations
                        in a game. Let&#39;s take a look at one specific example, the Dustloop page for the character I-No in Guilty Gear XX: Accent Core Plus R.

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        From here, we can see that this part of the page refers to one of her moves (the Kick button when the joystick is set to a neutral position).
                        Many terms such as FRC, burst, hitbox, jump install, Gatling, and many more, are used. Without knowing what these terms mean, this would be
                        almost impossible for the everyday reader to understand. However, one must understand that these terms are necessary as it effectively
                        communicates ideas to players (Dustloop, n.d.).

                        Esports streaming services make sure they have some exclusivity in terms of the reproduction of the most significant events, just like in
                        traditional sports leagues. This is why if you want to watch, for instance, ESL One events from back in 2019, when they collaborated with
                        Facebook Gaming, you had to go to dedicated esports streaming alternatives (&quot;Esports Streaming&quot;, n.d.).

                            <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a> - Twitch has long been praised as the top platform for Esports streaming and is now the largest one available. Twitch has done
                            a remarkable job of ensuring that its platform houses devoted partner broadcasters who are well-known figures in the gaming industry, despite
                            the occasional controversy around its regulations. Yes, a key element in Twitch's success is that only well-known influencers use their Esports
                            broadcasting service. However, in addition to continuing to be one of the dominant companies in this sector, this platform was also the one
                            that transformed the way we watch Esports (&quot;Esports Streaming&quot;, n.d.).

                            YouTube Gaming's debut into the Esports broadcasting industry. With a "follow" feature, Facebook saw chances to expand its audience inside the

                            resorted to aggressive attempts to become one of the top Esports broadcasting platforms. Unfortunately, YouTube has failed as an esports broadcasting
                            platform when it comes to tournaments since it has been unable to negotiate deals with the most significant esports leagues. In this approach,
                            YouTube exclusively broadcasts live the most significant competitions, such as the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or League of Legends global leagues (&quot;Esports Streaming&quot;, n.d.).
